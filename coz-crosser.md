# Coz Crosser (Pathfinder)

Itinerant preacher and ~~servant of the Church of Sarenrae~~ bringer of the **true** light of Sarenrae. *By the Sun we see it clearly, and the lies we are told become like wet paper in the rain! For what else are they? A layer of soft shade laid over your life, so that you mistake what you can plainly see for a dream.*

*But fear not! The dragons of Cheliax and the armies of slavery have no power to hold the free-minded, the generous-souled, the patient-in-the-world!*

  * **Level**: 1
  * **Race**: Human
  * **Class**: Paladin

*A huge, rotund man wearing a black suit that just covers his chainmail shirt.*

**Drawbacks**: [**Headstrong**](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/traits/drawbacks/headstrong)

*The following have no mechanical effect; they're just a character-building idea stolen from Unknown Armies. Rage is what enrages Coz, Fear is what makes him afraid, Obsession is what he can't stop thinking about, Noble is what inspires him to selflessness.*

  * **Rage**: When he believes that complacency & failure to "get it" have caused widespread harm. 
  * **Fear**: Coz is absolutely terrified of being mind-controlled; even the threat of it reduces him to a gibbering wreck. He is less severely terrified of being tricked or duped into believing something that isn't true (and overcompensates accordingly).
  * **Obsession**: A complex conspiracy theory, spanning countries, which involves his former associates at the Church of Sarenrae in Magnimar. Verges on the metaphysical, changes daily as Coz believes he is getting closer to the truth.
  * **Noble**: Like the Dr. Bronner of our world, Coz loves the idea of unifying all the world under his philosophy. Less loftily, banding together with others to defeat (what he sees as) an oppressive force inspires in him great effort and bravery.
