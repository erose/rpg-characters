#Features

**Divination Savant**
The gold and time you must spend to copy a divination spell into your spellbook is halved. (to 1hr + 25gp per level of the spell).

**Portent**
Glimpses of the future begin to press in on your awareness. When you finish a long rest, roll two d205 and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn.

Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.

##History

Abraham was a civil servant in the 

  * **Fear**
    Abraham has never made peace with being old, and in his heart of hearts he's scared of dying.
    
  * **Rage**
    Abraham will cheerfully discuss any matter (though he has a way of assuming everyone agrees with him), but he will become enraged if he thinks anyone is attempting to conceal information from him. This happens only in quite egregious cases, since he is quite gullible.
    
  * **Obsession**
    A complicated metaphysical and political theory which, he truly believes, explains all happenings in the universe -- if only you have the courage to interpret the signs. Abraham has been building this theory for thirty years, ever since his retirement, and it animates his life.
  
  * **Noble**
    To educate the less fortunate! To discover and share the mysteries of the universe so that violence will cease, hunger will retreat to the wilderness, and all shall know the peace of knowledge.
