**Name:** Nora Bellwether

  - **Charm:** 0
  - **Cool:** +2
  - **Sharp:** +2
  - **Tough:** -1
  - **Weird:** -1 

**Agency:** Local Government (Nora is the mayor of Skookum, Oregon and can draw on the resources provided by her humble office.)
  - Pros
    - Well-armed
    - Recognised authority
  - Cons
    - Budget cuts
    - Inter-departmental rivalry

**Professional Moves:**
  - **Bottle It Up**: If you want, you can take up to +3 bonus when you act under pressure. For each +1 you use, the Keeper holds 1. That hold can be spent later -- one for one -- to give you -1 on any move except under pressure.
  - **Mobility**: I have a pickup truck.
  - Good things:
    - Roomy
    - Concealed weapons
  - Bad things:
    - Loud
  - **Medic**: You have a full first aid kit, and the training to heal people. When you do first aid, roll +Cool. On a 10+ the patient is stabilized and healed of 2 harm. On a 7-9 choose one: heal 2 harm or stabilize the injury. On a miss, you cause an extra 1 harm. This move takes the place of regular first aid.
  - **Deal With The Agency**:
    - When you deal with the Agency, requesting help or gear, or making excuses for a failure, roll +Sharp. On a 10+, you’re good—your request for gear or person-nel is okayed, or your slip-up goes unnoticed. On a 7-9, things aren’t so great. You might get chewed out by your superiors and there’ll be fallout, but you get what  you  need  for  the  job.  On  a  miss,  you  screwed  up: you might be suspended or under investigation, or just in the doghouse. You certainly aren’t going to get any help until you sort it all out.

Weapons: (Nora is a big hunter, but even that doesn't quite account for how well-armed she is.)
  - Flak vest. (1-armor hidden)
  - Sniper rifle. (4-harm far)
  - Hunting rifle. (2-harm far loud)
  - Shotgun. (3-harm close messy)
