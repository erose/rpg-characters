Class Features:
  - **Divine Sense**
    - 1 + CHA modifier (**3**) uses per day.
  
  - **Lay on Hands**
    - Pool of healing equal to (5 x paladin level = **25**) hit points per day. Or expend 5 points from the pool to cure a disease or neutralize a poision.

  - **Fighting Style**
    - Protection: When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.

  - **Divine Smite**
    - When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one paladin spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend.

  - **Divine Health**
    - Immue to disease.
  
  - **Sacred Oath: Oath of the Ancients**
    - **Channel Divinity**: Once per long or short rest, do one of the following.
      - Primeval forces ensnare a foe. As an action, you can cause spectral vines to spring up and reach for a creature within  10 feet of you that you can see. The creature must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice) or be restrained. While restrained by the vines, the creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it frees itself and the vines vanish.
      - Utter ancient words that are painful for fey and fiends to hear. As an action, you speak the words and each fey or fiend within 30 feet of you that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is turned for 1  minute or until it takes damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. If the creature’s true form is concealed by an illusion, shapeshifting, or other effect, that form is revealed while it is turned.
